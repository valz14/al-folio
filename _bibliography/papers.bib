  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

abstract = {Two common approaches for automating IoT smart spaces are having users write rules using trigger-action programming (TAP) or training machine learning models based on observed actions. In this paper, we unite these approaches. We introduce and evaluate Trace2TAP, a novel method for automatically synthesizing TAP rules from traces (time-stamped logs of sensor readings and manual actuations of devices). We present a novel algorithm that uses symbolic reasoning and SAT-solving to synthesize TAP rules from traces. Compared to prior approaches, our algorithm synthesizes generalizable rules more comprehensively and fully handles nuances like out-of-order events. Trace2TAP also iteratively proposes modified TAP rules when users manually revert automations. We implemented our approach on Samsung SmartThings. Through formative deployments in ten offices, we developed a clustering/ranking system and visualization interface to intelligibly present the synthesized rules to users. We evaluated Trace2TAP through a field study in seven additional offices. Participants frequently selected rules ranked highly by our clustering/ranking system. Participants varied in their automation priorities, and they sometimes chose rules that would seem less desirable by traditional metrics like precision and recall. Trace2TAP supports these differing priorities by comprehensively synthesizing TAP rules and bringing humans into the loop during automation.},

abstract = {Trigger-action programming lets end-users automate and connect IoT devices and online services through if-this-then-that rules. Early research demonstrated this paradigm's usability, but more recent work has highlighted complexities that arise in realistic scenarios. As users manually modify or debug their programs, or as they use recently proposed automated tools to the same end, they may struggle to understand how modifying a trigger-action program changes its ultimate behavior. To aid in this understanding, we prototype user interfaces that visualize differences between trigger-action programs in syntax, behavior, and properties.},

abstract="Because machine learning would benefit from reduced data requirements, some prior work has proposed using humans not just to label data, but also to explain those labels. To characterize the evidence humans might want to provide, we conducted a user study and a data experiment. In the user study, 75 participants provided classification labels for 20 photos, justifying those labels with free-text explanations. Explanations frequently referenced concepts (objects and attributes) in the image, yet 26{\%} of explanations invoked concepts not in the image. Boolean logic was common in implicit form, but was rarely explicit. In a follow-up experiment on the Visual Genome dataset, we found that some concepts could be partially defined through their relationship to frequently co-occurring concepts, rather than only through labeling.",

    abstract = {Compared to individuals in lower positions of power, higher-power individuals are theorized to be less motivated to attend to social cues. In support of this theory, previous research has consistently documented negative correlations between social class and emotion perception. Prior studies, however, were limited by the size and diversity of the participant samples as well as the systematicity with which social class and emotion perception were operationalized. Here, we examine the generalizability of prior research across 10,000+ total participants. In an initial modest sample, (n = 179), Study 1 partially replicated past results: emotion identification correlated negativity with subjective social class (β = -0.15, 95% CI = [-0.28,-0.02]) and one of two objective social class measures (participant education β = -0.15, 95% CI = [-0.03,-0.01]). Studies 2–4 followed up on Study 1’s mixed results for objective social class in three much larger samples. These results diverged from past literature. In Study 2, complex emotion identification correlated non-significantly with participant education (β = 0.02, p = 0.25; 95% CI = [-0.01, 0.05], n = 2,726), positively with childhood family income (β = 0.03, 95% CI = [0.01,0.06], n = 4,312), and positively with parental education (β = 0.06, 95% CI = [0.04,0.09], n = 4,225). In Study 3, basic emotion identification correlated positively with participant education (β = 0.05, 95% CI = [0.02, 0.09]), n = 2,564). In Study 4, basic emotion discrimination correlated positively with participant education (β = 0.09, 95% CI = [0.05,0.13], n = 2,079), positively with parental education (β = 0.06, 95% CI = [0.02,0.09], n = 3,225), and non-significantly with childhood family income (β = 0.2, 95% CI = [0.01,0.07], n = 3,272). Results remained similar when restricting analyses to U.S.-based participants. Taken together, these findings suggest that previously reported negative correlations between emotion perception and social class may generalize poorly past select samples and/or subjective measures of social class. Data from the three large web-based samples used in Studies 2–4 are available at osf.io/jf7r3 as normative datasets and to support future investigations of these and other research questions.},

title="Evaluation of Dynamic Binary Instrumentation Approaches: Dynamic Binary Translation vs. Dynamic Probe Injection",
year={2018},
journal = {Wellesley College Undergraduate Honors Thesis Collection},
abstract="From web browsing to bank transactions, to data analysis and robot automation, just about any task necessitates or benefits from the use of software. Ensuring a piece of software to be effective requires profiling the program's behavior to evaluate its performance, debugging the program to fix incorrect behaviors, and examining the program to detect security flaws. These tasks are made possible by instrumentation---the method of inserting code into a program to collect data about its behavior. Dynamic binary instrumentation (DBI) enables programmers to understand and reason about program behavior by inserting code into a binary during run time to collect relevant data, and is more flexible than static or source-code instrumentation, but incurs run-time overhead. This thesis attempts to extend the preexisting characterization of the tradeoffs between dynamic binary translation (DBT) and dynamic probe injection (DPI), two popular DBI approaches, using Pin and LiteInst as sample frameworks. It also describes extensions to the LiteInst framework that enable it to instrument function exits correctly. This evaluation involved using the two frameworks to instrument a set of SPEC CPU 2006 benchmarks for counting function entries alone, counting both function entries and exits, or dynamically generating a call graph. On these instrumentation tasks, Pin performed close to native binary time while LiteInst performed significantly slower. Exceptions to this observation, and analysis of the probe types used by LiteInst, suggest that LiteInst incurs significant overhead when executing a large number of probes.",

abstract = {The principle of least authority states that each component of a software system must have only the authority necessary for its execution and nothing else. This principle is a cornerstone of the security of software applications, but it is difficult to enforce in practice. Current programming languages, as well as non-linguistic approaches, do not provide adequate control over the authority of untrusted modules [1, 5]. To fill this gap, we designed and implemented a capability-based module system that facilitates controlling the security capabilities of software modules [2]. Furthermore, we are currently working on augmenting our module system with an effect system to make our design authority-safe. Our approach simplifies the process of ensuring that a software system maintains the principle of least authority, and also allows for attenuation of module authority [3]. Our design is implemented as part of the Wyvern programming language [4].},
