Hello! I'm Valerie, a 3rd-year PhD student in Computer Science at the University
of Chicago advised by [Blase Ur](https://www.blaseur.com/){:target="\_blank"}. My work focuses on building tools
to help non-technical users leverage trigger-action programming for applications such as smart home
automation.
More broadly, my research interests spans end-user programming and automation, usable security, human-computer interaction, and human-robot interaction.

I was a student volunteer for UbiComp in 2019 and one of two [CERES](https://ceres.cs.uchicago.edu/index.html){:target="\_blank"} scholars in 2018. Before that, I
graduated from
Wellesley College in
2018 majoring in Neuroscience and Computer Science with honors.
